# compute-shader-boid

An in progress Unity project simulating the flocking behaviour of bird. The original concept is from [Craid Reynolds' paper](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.103.7187)
published in 1987 for the ACM SIGGRAPH conference. 

In my first year of university I wrote a 2D version of this in Processing. This project is both nostalgic and a way for me to dip my toes in compute shaders and High-level shader language (HLSL).
